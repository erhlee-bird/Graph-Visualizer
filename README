Version 0.05:
    Modified 07/14/11
    : Changes were made to optimize the data storage. All
    pertinent edges are contained within the Node so that
    searching for them is cheap and they are easily
    accessible for color-coding.
    : Redid the entire drawing system and made Edges a lot
    cheaper to draw and analyze.
    : Redid my random drawing algorithm to favor larger
    nodes towards the center. Looks a lot better than the
    previous random layout.
    : Made the program a lot more efficient overall and
    I'm pleased with how my little "EdgeMaster" excursion
    turned out.

Version 0.04:
    Modified 07/13/11
    : I went and corrected the color coding algorithm and
    changed the storage structures for the temporary marks.
    : Fixed the Nodes and Edges so that they can reDraw
    themselves.
    : Got down a good method of calculating the canvas size.
    : Gonna work a bit on the UI. So far I have the graph
    drawn and interactable in a slightly useless and arcane
    manner.

Version 0.03:
    Modified 07/12/11
    : So I realized I should have split up the info storage
    into classes like Node.py and Edge.py but I was excited
    and kind of just rushing through so I've just added it.
    : I changed the lists to dictionaries so I can keep the
    Nodes in order and have a slick way to access them.
    : Internalized a lot of the mathematic functions to one
    time use in the Node class. A lot less waste. I'm not
    explaining it very well but it makes sense.
    : Who doesn't love color coding.
    : Next up is scaling work. This is gonna be kinda hard.

Version 0.02:
    Modified 07/11/11
    : Redid the parsing work because the storage system was
    much too confusing and stupid.
    : I'm doing stuff wrong. It's taking more than a few 
    seconds to load a relatively small graph. I think I
    need to look up how to optimize my list comprehensions.
    : Finally managed to figure out the canvas's drawing.
    : Coming along nicely.

Version 0.01:
    Created 07/10/11
    : This is a basic python tool for parsing and visualizing
    graphs.
    : Got some basic parsing support for .gexf files.
    : Got the basic Tkinter Canvas working albeit with some
    issues with automatic resizing.
